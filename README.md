# Classification Using SVM in Python
SVM or "Support Vector Machine" is a supervised machine learning algorithm, mostly used for classifcation purpose, also termed as SVC (Support Vector Classification).
It supports both linear and non linear scenario. It uses 'kernel trick' to tackle non linearity and called as kernal SVM.
## Description
In this algorithm, we plot each feature or data as a point into n-dimensional space where n is no. of features we have and the value of each feature is the value of corrusponding coordinate.
Classification is performed by finding or adjusting the hyperplane that classifies the data (differentiate the classes) very well.
Hence, the goal of SVM is to generate a line or hyperplane that saperates the classes very well.
## Implementation
A python library 'Scikit Learn' provides 'SVC' class, which is used to implement SVM.
